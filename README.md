# Pokemon-Clone-OpenGL
Pokemon Clone made using DirectX 12 and C++ - Restriction: Made it in 7 weeks
# Synopsis
In my second year of college I was learning how to code tilemapped 2D games in C++. The objectives for this game were as follows:

1. Create and link a shader program capable of sampling and displaying textures a data folder
2. Create a tilemap level for your game, with traversable and non-traversable tiles
3. Have a player character that can be moved by the user
4. Have AI controlled characters that can navigate the level using A-Star pathfinding method

The objectives I added for myself were:

5. Characters must be animated
6. Multiple Levels
7. Interactable tiles
8. I have to make a pokemon clone XD

As it was stated at the top, I only had 7 weeks to complete my work. I do however want to continue building it out, but I thought I should commit it as is
to show what was completed in the allotted time. 

# Highlights
Created a Resource manager that parses a json for tile info and creates textured tiles using coordinates from a sprite sheet
Created Sprite and Tile Managers for animated characters and level generation
Used bit shifting and short arrays to specify tile placement and position for levels
Used canvas layers for depth

# Future Development Plans
I do plan to continue adding to this framework to eventually finish out the Pokemon game.
